First post on my brand new Jekyll blog. Just for testing and improving my skills in ruby and also in english. 
Probably most posts will be written in english but sometimes I'll also (sometimes) write in Polish which is my primary language, apart from C/C++.

I create this blog to see how this whole ruby stuff works. I'm not intersted in creating a normal blog. For me it's only place to share and increase my experience in programing. But I will also post normal texts, for non-IT-folks

Next steps:

 * install plugins for Jekyll (github, latex, etc)
 * customize layout
 * write some own plugins

This is not work for one week. It's rather continous part time job. I'll do it in my free time which is really limited and sometimes imaginary.
