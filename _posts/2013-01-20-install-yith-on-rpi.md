I'm proud user of Raspberry PI. I had beeen waiting for it about 5 months
but at last I got it. If you dont know what Raspberry Pi is I can recomend http://youtu.be/u4THiC5-JZo
Leader of this project will tell you why and how it was build.
I haven't got time to play with it before, but for
me it's really amazing that for only 35$ I got working machine taht supports 
HD films. I spent some time testing it and it works just great. Maybe it's not
so fast and require rather patient user but IMO it's great chance for popularize
free and open software, and show that programming could be fun.
From geeks prespective rPI is just cheep compuiter that theyu can hack 
without spending money on it. And as you probably see rPi is used everywhere.
