Sometimes I have problem to focus on programming. I know this should never happen but sometimes it does. Following 
list help me to bring me back to code. I didn't make numbered list as you could usually see on toplists but order is not 
unintentional.


### Code Monkey
My absoulutely favourite song. Whats more great it's available directly on Spotify so I added it to my daily playlist.
Story told by Jonathan Culton is so true and what's more important non programming folks could understand it too.

### Java Zone
Orginally perfomed by Lady Java (do not confuse with Lady Gaga).

### And so you code
From time to time, I do mechanical work that I've done before thousand times but for some reason I can't automate it.
This help me keep rhythm.
