Sometimes I have problem to focus on programming. I know this should never happen but sometimes it does. Following 
list help me to bring me back to code. I didn't make numbered list as you could usually see on toplists but order is not 
unintentional.


### Code Monkey
My absoulutely favourite song. Whats more great it's available directly on Spotify so I added it to my daily playlist.
Story told by Jonathan Culton is so true and what's more important non programming folks could understand it too.

Orginally perfomed by Lady Java (do not confuse with Lady Gaga).

### And so you code
From time to time, I do mechanical work that I've done before thousand times but for some reason I can't automate it.
This help me keep rhythm.
